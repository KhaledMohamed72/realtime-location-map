## ‚ú® Features

- Real-time location updates via WebSockets
- Interactive map display using Leaflet.js
- Store and view historical location data
- Time-based filtering of location trails
- REST API for sending and retrieving location data

---

## üìä Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP)
- **Real-time Server:** Node.js with Socket.io
- **Pub/Sub:** Redis
- **Frontend Map:** Leaflet.js
- **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL

## üöß Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/realtime-location-tracking.git
cd realtime-location-tracking
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Laravel)

```bash
cd laravel-backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
# Configure DB and Redis in .env
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

### 3. Node.js Real-time Server

```bash
cd node-server
npm install
node index.js
```

### 4. Redis

Ensure Redis is installed and running on the default port (6379):

```bash
redis-server
```

### 5. Frontend

Open the HTML file in your browser:

```bash
cd frontend
open index.html
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- Laravel runs on `http://localhost:8000`
- Node.js Socket.io server runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- Redis default port: `6379`
- Make sure `.env` file in Laravel is configured with correct DB and Redis settings

## üìÅ API Endpoints

### POST /api/locations

     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"latitude": 41.712776, "longitude": -74.005974}'
```

### GET /api/locations?start=2024-01-01&end=2024-01-31

## ‚è∞ Real-Time Flow

1. Laravel receives location via API.
2. Laravel broadcasts an event to Redis.
3. Node.js server subscribes to Redis, receives the event.
4. Socket.io emits it to all connected clients.
5. Leaflet.js updates the map in real-time.
